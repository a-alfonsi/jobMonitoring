# :triangular_flag_on_post: jobMonitoring

This is an online job monitoring interface based on [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and jQuery.
It parses user and job status data from a xml file (which must be generated and updated constantly by the server) and conveniently shows them in a table for the user to read, with no need to ssh to the remote machine that is running the jobs everytime.

I originally developed this project in 2019, and reporting here the code skeleton that could be easily adapted to other servers.
Requisited to use DataTables are listed [here](https://datatables.net/manual/installation).
